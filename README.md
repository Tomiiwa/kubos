KubOS is an open-source software stack for satellites.

The KubOS system is designed to take care of every aspect of a satellite’s flight
software.

Rather than operating as a single, monolithic entity, KubOS is comprised of a series
of independent, yet interoperating components.

- Mission applications control and execute the logic necessary to accomplish mission goals
- Services expose hardware and system functionality with a controlled and uniform interface
- Kubos Linux provides the base operating system and the drivers needed to communicate with connected hardware devices
